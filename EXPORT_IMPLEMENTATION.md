# Data Export Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

The data export functionality has been enhanced to meet the specific requirements for both XLSX and CSV formats.

### Previous Behavior:
- **XLSX**: Single sheet with all data in original format (timestamp, value, measurement, bucket columns)
- **CSV**: Flat export with timestamp, value, measurement, bucket columns

### New Behavior:

#### XLSX Export:
- **Grouped by timestamp**: Data is organized chronologically
- **Separate sheets per bucket**: Each InfluxDB bucket gets its own worksheet
- **Measurements as columns**: Within each sheet, measurements become columns

Example structure:
```
Sheet "home_sensors":
timestamp                | temperature | humidity
2024-01-01T10:00:00Z    | 23.5        | 60.2
2024-01-01T10:05:00Z    | 23.8        | 59.8
2024-01-01T10:10:00Z    | 24.1        | 58.5

Sheet "energy_meters":
timestamp                | power  | voltage
2024-01-01T10:00:00Z    | 150.5  | 220.1
2024-01-01T10:05:00Z    | 155.2  | 219.8
2024-01-01T10:10:00Z    | 148.9  | 221.3
```

#### CSV Export:
- **Grouped by timestamp**: Each row represents a point in time
- **Bucket:measurement columns**: Each unique bucket:measurement pair becomes a column

Example structure:
```
timestamp,home_sensors:temperature,home_sensors:humidity,energy_meters:power,energy_meters:voltage
2024-01-01T10:00:00Z,23.5,60.2,150.5,220.1
2024-01-01T10:05:00Z,23.8,59.8,155.2,219.8
2024-01-01T10:10:00Z,24.1,58.5,148.9,221.3
```

## Implementation Details

### Functions Added:
1. `groupDataByTimestampAndBucket(readings)` - Groups data for XLSX format
2. `convertToTimeseriesFormat(timestampData)` - Converts to Excel-friendly arrays
3. `groupDataForCSV(readings)` - Groups data for CSV format with bucket:measurement columns

### Key Features:
- **Chronological sorting**: All data is sorted by timestamp
- **Efficient grouping**: Data is grouped to minimize redundant timestamp entries
- **Flexible column naming**: CSV uses bucket:measurement format for clear identification
- **Multiple sheet support**: XLSX automatically creates sheets based on available buckets

## Testing Results

The implementation was tested with sample sensor data including:
- Multiple buckets (home_sensors, energy_meters)
- Multiple measurements per bucket (temperature, humidity, power, voltage)
- Multiple timestamps

Both formats correctly group and organize the data as specified.

## Files Modified:
- `routes/export.js` - Main export route with new transformation functions
- `.gitignore` - Updated to exclude test files
